HartreeParticleDSL.backends.C\_AOS package
==========================================

The C_AOS module is an initial proof-of-concept backend for HartreePArticleDSL.

It is not yet updated to use PIR, and is very limited in its support, however it
does support all kernel types currently implemented.

It is not optimised for performance, and is not recommended for use.
